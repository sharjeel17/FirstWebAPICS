# FirstWebAPI
Web API in ASP.NET to get hands on experience with APIs.      
This is a pokemon review api and is only an API based off of a tutorial      
Some of the concepts I have learnt during this project include but not limited to:     
•	Repository Pattern  
•	Dependency Injection  
•	Dependency Injection types in ASP.NET (AddSingleton, AddScoped and Addtransient)       
•	Object relational mapping (ORM)

•	Data Transfer Objects     
•	Auto-mapper
